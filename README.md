# Genetic Algorithm: an example
This is an html5 + js application for experimenting with the implementation of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm" target="_blank">genetic algorithm</a> for polynomial interpolation.
It exploits <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/">chart.js</a> and <a href="https://jquery.com">jquery</a>, and should run on any sufficiently new browser.

Run it <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/lmari/GA/blob/master/GA.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

This is a short explanation of what can be set up via the control panel of the application.
* numPts (from 2 to 20): number of genes = number of points of the polynomials = number of parameters of the polynomials = 1 + order of the polynomials
* ...
* ...
